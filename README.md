# RSA_Algorithm_Project
RSA Public-Key Cryptosystem
In this project, block cipher is executed in ECB mode, RSA encryption algorithm is used. Key 
pairs are generated in the “KeyGeneration” class. Operations with p, q, e, n, d values are done 
here. Public key and Private key values and whether they are prime can be tested here. Key 
pairs are generated in the "AllKeys" class. In the "RSA_Algorithm" class, RSA encryption and 
decryption algorithms are used. ASCII and string conversion methods are included in this class. 
Ciphertext stealing algorithm is also implemented in this class. A simple GUI has been 
developed in the "Main" class, the details of which are as in the images below.
There are 3 buttons. The user must first generate a key, then choose one of these keys.
